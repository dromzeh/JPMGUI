# JPMGUI (Java Path Manager GUI)
- GUI for easily modifying Java Path / Environment Variables made with C# for Windows Only.
- Note: This is just a program I quickly made in an hour as I constantly found switching between Java Paths was tiring. I might add more to this in the future.
- You can Compile this yourself using VS2022.

# Usage
Program is simple to use, select your Java folder, then in the dropdown select the Java Version you want to use, then 'Set Path'.
